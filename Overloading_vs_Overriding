Some basic concepts need to be enunciated clearly for a good grasp.

We discuss differences between Overloading and Overriding

Overloading is a term used to describe when two methods have the same name but differ in the type or the number of arguments.

public double computeArea(Circle c) {....}
public double computeArea(Square s){.....}

Overriding , however occurs when a method shares the same name and function signature as another method in its super class.

public abstract class Shape {
   public void printMe() {
      System.out.print("I am a shape.");
   }
   public abstract double computeArea();
  }
  
  public double computeArea() {
      return rad * rad * 3.15;
      }
      
  public class Ambiguous extends Shape {
     private double area = 10;
     public double computeArea() {
         return area;
      }
   }
   
   public class IntroductionOverriding {
      public sttaic void main(String[] args) {
         Shape[] shapes = new Shape[2];
         Circle circle = new Circle();
         Ambiguous ambiguous = new Ambiguous();
         
         shapes[0] = circle;
         shapes[1] = ambiguous;
         
         for(Shape s : shapes ) {
             s.printMe();
             System.out.println(s.computeArea());
         }
     }
  }
