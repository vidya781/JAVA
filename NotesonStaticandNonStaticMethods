A static method belongs to the class while a non static method belongs to an object of the class.

Static methods--useful if you have only one instance where you are going to use the method and you dont need multiple copies ( objects )

Non static methods are used if you are going to use your method to create multiple copies.

public class TestClass{
   public static void(String[] args) {
     display();
   }
   
public static void display(){
   System.out.println(" Call from static methods ");
   }
}

Non static example

public class TestClass {
   public static void main(String[] args){
      TestClass tc = new TestClass();
      tc.display();
      
      //object created here because display is a non-static method
    }
  public void display(){
     System.out.println( " Call from non-static method ");
     }
   }
