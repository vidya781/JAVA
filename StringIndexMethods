The program below demonstrates the sting searching methods indexOf and lastindexOf. Adapted from Dietel.

public class StringIndexMethods
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      String letters = "abcdefghijklmabcdefghijklm";
      
      //test indexOf to loacte a character in a string
      System.out.printf(" 'c' is located at index %d\n", letters.indexOf( 'c'));
      System.out.printf(" 'a' is located at index %d\n",letters.indexOf('a',1));
      System.out.printf(" '$' is located at index %d\n\n",letters.indexOf('$'));
      
      // test lastIndexOf to find a character in a string
      System.out.printf("Last 'c' is located at index %d\n",letters.lastIndexOf('c'));
      System.out.printf("Last 'a' is located at index %d\n",letters.lastIndexOf('a'));
      System.out.printf("Last '$' is located at index %d\n\n",letters.lastIndexOf('$'));
      
      // test indexOf to locate a substring in a string
      System.out.printf("\"def\" is located at index %d\n",letters.indexOf("def");
      System.out.prntf("\"def\" is located at index %d\n",letters.indexOf("def",7));
      System.out.printf("\"hello\" is located at index %d\n\n",letters.indexOf("hello"));
      
      //test lastIndexOf to find a substring in a string
      System.out.printf("Last \"def\" is located at index %d\n",letters.lastIndexOf("def"));
      System.out.printf("Last \"def\" is located at index %d\n",letters.lastIndexOf("def",25));
      System.out.printf("Last \"hello\" is located at index %d\n",letters.lastIndexOf("hello"));
      }  // end main
   }  // end class StringIndexMethods
