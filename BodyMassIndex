The algorithm below demonstrates how to calculate the body mass index also called BMI. 

Mathematically BMI = Weight/(height)^2   // attributed to Adolphe Quetelet

Mass is in kilograms, Height is in meters.

Health risks associated with BMI are:
1) Underweight < 18.5
2) Normal weight >= 18.5 and < 25
3) Overweight >= 25 and < 30
4) Obese >= 30

A conversion is in order from pounds to kilograms ( 1 kg = 2.2 pounds)
Convert feet and inches to meters. If everything is in inches, multiply by 0.0254 to convert inches to meters.

Algorithm to calculate BMI

1) Read the weight in pounds to the variable in pounds
2) Read the height in feet to the variable in feet
3) Read the additional height in inches into the variable inches
4) Set the variable heightMeters to the value ((feet*12) + inches) * 0.0254
5) Set the variable mass to the value pounds / 2.2
6) Set the variable BMI to the value mass/ (heightMeters) * (heightMeters)
7) Output BMI
8) If BMI < 18.5 then output 'Underweight'
9) Else if BMI < 25, then output 'Normal Weight'
10) Else if BMI < 30, then output 'Overweight'

     inches = keyboard.nextInt();
     heightMeters = ((feet * 12) + inches) * 0.0254;
     mass = (pounds / 2.2);
     BMI = mass / (heightMeters * heightMeters);
     System.out.println("Your BMI is " + BMI);
     System.out.print("Your risk category is ");
     if (BMI < 18.5)
         System.out.println("Underweight.");
     else if (BMI < 25)
         System.out.println("Normal weight.");
     else if (BMI < 30)
