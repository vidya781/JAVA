Delete consecutive same words in a sequence

Given a sequence of strings, task is to check if any 2 similar words come together then destroy
each other and then print the words left in the sequence after this pairwise destruction

Input : tom jerry jerry tom
Output 2

Its clear we need a recursive program of some sort for the word cancellation.

Check for equality of words consecutively in a pairwise manner 

In the above example, tom and jerry are compared but are not equal so jerry and jerry are compared and are equal so they are cancelled
so the input now becomes tom tom and again the comparison is done and since we find equality in tom tom the 2 words cancel out and we are left with 0

import java.util.Vector;

class removeconsecutive
{
   // Method to find the size of the manipulated sequence
    
    static int removeconsecutivesame(Vector <String> v)
    {
      int n = v.size();

       // Start traversing the sequence
       for(int i = 0; i < n-1;)
       {
          if(v.get(i).equals(v.get(i+1)))
          {
           v.remove(i); // Erase function deletes the elem and also shifts other elems thats why i is not updated
           v.remove(i);

           if (i > 0)  // update i, as to check from previous elem again
               i--;

            // Reduce sequence size
            n = n-2;
           }

           else
               i++;
        }
       return v.size();
    }

  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Vector<String> v = new Vector<>();
    v.addElement("tom"); v.addElement("jrry");
    v.addElement("jerry");v.addElement("tom");
    System.out.println(removeConsecutiveSame(v));
   }
  }
