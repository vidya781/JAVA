Given two numbers a and b and the task is to check whether the concatenation of a and b is a perfect square or not.

Input: a = 1, b = 21

Output: 121 = 11 * 11 is a perfect square

Input : a = 100, b = 100
Output :No

100100 is not a perfect square

Pseudo code for the following:

1) String or concatenate the two numbers
2) get its factors 
3) Loop through the list o factors and check if multiplication of any of its factors by itself leads to the concatenated number
4) If the result is true then it is a perfect square else its not

Java code for the same:

import java.lang.*;

class perfectsquarestringnumber{

       static void perfectsquare(String s1, String s2)
       {
         int c = Integer.valueOf(s1 + s2);
         // square root of number
         int d = (int)Math.sqrt(c);
         if(d*d == c){
            System.out.println("Yes");
           }
          else {
            System.out.println("No");
           }
        }
       // Driver code
       public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        String s1 = "12";
        String s2 = "1";
        perfectsquare(s1,s2);
      }
   }
