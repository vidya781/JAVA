Tw students were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 the quality of food in he student cafeteria, with 1 being "awful" and 5 being "Excellent".
Place the 20 responses in an array and determine the frequency of each rating.

We call this the Poll Analysis program

public class StudentPoll
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
    // student response array
    int[] responses = {1,2,5,4,3,5,2,2,3,3,1,4,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,1,4};
    
    int[] frequency = new int[6]; //array of frequnecy counters
    
    //for each answer, select the responses element and use taht value as frequency index to determine element to increment
    
    for(int answer = 0; answer < responses.length; answer++)
    {
      try
      {
        ++frequency[responses[answer]];
      } // end the try loop
      catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
      {
        System.out.println(e);
        System.out.printf("  responses[%d] = %d\n\n",answer,responses[answer]);
      } // end catch
    } // end for
  
  System.out.printf("%s%10s\n","Rating","Frequency");
  
  //output each array element's value
  for(int rating = 1; rating < frequency.length;length++)
      System.out.printf("%6d%10d\n",rating, frequency[rating]);
    } // end main
  }// end class StudentPoll
