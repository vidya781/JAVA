Solution:

Using Bitwise XOR(^) Operator

class Swap1
{ 
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
     int x = 5 , y = 10;
     x = x ^ y ^ (y = x);
     System.out.println("Values of x and y after swapping are " + x + " and " + y);
  }
}

Using addition and subtraction operator

class Swap2
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
     int x = 5, y = 10;
     x = x + y - (y = x);
     System.out.println("Values of x and y after swapping are " + x + " and " + y);
  }
}

Using multiplication and division operator

class Swap3
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     int x = 5, y = 10;
     x = (x * y)/(y = x);
     System.out.println("Values of x and y after swapping are " + x + " and " + y);
     }
  }
