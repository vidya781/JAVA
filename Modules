Modules

A module declaration introduces a module name that can be used in other module declarations to express relationships 
between modules.

A module name consists of one or more Java identifiers separated by "." tokens

There are two kinds of modules:normal modules and open modules.

The kind of a module determines access to the module's types and the members of those types for code outside the module.

A normal module without the open modifier, grants access at compile time and run time to types in only those packages which are explicitly exported.

An open module with the open modifier, grants access at compile time to types in only those packages which are explicitly exported, but grants access
at run time to types in all its packages, as if all packages had been exported.
